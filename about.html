   About Me

 <div>
   <ul><text class="mediumtext">About Me</text>
     <li class="smalltext">My name is <strong>Fraser Nicholson</strong> and I am in my 2nd year,
      studying <strong>Physics</strong> at the <strong>University of Warwick</strong>.
    </li>
   </ul>
   
 </div>

  <br>

 <div>
   <ul><text class="mediumtext">My interests include:</text>
     <br>
     <br>
     
     <li class="smalltext"><strong>Problem Solving</strong> - This is shown by my continued interest in the subjects of Maths and Physics,
      and my commitment to partake in a degree in Physics.
    </li>
      
     <br>
     <br>
     
      <li class="smalltext"><strong>Programming</strong> - Not only have I done a certain amount of back-end progamming using Python within
        my degree, I have also taught myself (using many different resources) different front and back-end programming languages;
         this includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript (which are demonstrated using this website). I have also learnt basic PHP.
        </li>
     
     <br>
     <br>
     
      <li class="smalltext"><strong>Web Development</strong> - This is heavily tied into the above interest, but my increasing knowledge in
      front-end programming is due to my interest in web development.
      </li>
     
     <br>
     <br>
     
       <li class="smalltext"><strong>Cyber Security</strong> - Ever since I found out that one of my distant family members was involved
        in the highly important (and secret) code breaking mission at Bletchley Park, I have always had an interest in
         how different security firms keep information out of the publics hands.
       </li>
     
     <br>
     <br>
     
     <li class="smalltext"><strong>Cricket</strong> - From a very young age I have always enjoyed playing and watching sport, with Cricket
      proving to be the sport I was most interested in. I have played from a very young age and feel that this has given
      me the skills to work extremely effectively in a team environment.

     </li>

     <br>
     <br>

     <li class="smalltext"><strong>Guitar</strong> - I have played guitar for more than half of my life, and have achieved a Grad 6 in the
      Classical Guitar. I believe that this shows that I can be committed to a long term project and be successful in this project.
